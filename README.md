# evoCell
 2D Abstract Platformer

evoCell follows the quest of a cute little cell to find as many gems as possible. It is said that when reaching 200 gems, the cell will have the potential energy to evolve into something new.

This game is a simple 2D platformer created using the 2D Abstract Platformer art asset pack available from kenney.nl at the link below:
