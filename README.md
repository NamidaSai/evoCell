# evoCell
 2D Abstract Platformer

evoCell follows the quest of a cute little cell to find as many gems as possible. It is said that when reaching 100 gems, the cell will have the potential energy to evolve into something new.

This game is a 10 minutes simple 2D platformer with 5 levels, made using the Unity Game Engine.

On the 6th of April 2020 I started learning game development in Unity with no prior experience. This game is the result of 7 intense weeks of learning and my first proper experience on my journey to become a game developer. It's far from perfect, it's simple and a little bit buggy, but it's my own and I'm proud of it.

All sound effects and music are my own. Soundtrack available at the link below:
